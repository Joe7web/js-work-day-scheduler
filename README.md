## Work Day Schedular Application


I created a Code-Quiz that allows entry-level developers to test their knowledge of coding.  An exciting game that displays multiple choice questions while racing against a timer.
The game start once the start button is clicked - the timer will start and the first question appears.  5 multiple choice questions and tracking of your high score.

I primarily used the dynamic function of JavaScript to enhance the HTML and CSS elements for the application.  At this time there are still bugs and incomplete code which will be corrected and updated in the future.

I was fortunate to have some assistance from Frank Craven my tutor and David the Learning Assistant.
